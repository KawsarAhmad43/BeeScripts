# Laravel Design Pattern

## Builder Pattern Implementation Overview

#### Code Components

- **Product:** The `Contact` model is the final object that the builder (`ContactBuilder`) constructs.

- **Builder:** The `ContactBuilder` class is the abstract interface defining construction steps.

- **ConcreteBuilder:** `ContactBuilder` implements the Builder interface to construct and assemble the `Contact` product.

- **Director:** Controller methods in `ContactController` act as a director, managing construction using `ContactBuilder`.

- **Client:** External code interacts with the director (`ContactController`) to initiate `Contact` construction.

#### Why Builder Pattern?

- **Complex Object Construction:** `ContactBuilder` simplifies `Contact` construction with individual attribute-setting methods.

- **Variety of Configurations:** Flexibility in constructing `Contact` objects with different configurations.

- **Readability:** Enhances code readability by separating construction logic from client code.

#### How It Works

1. Client initiates `Contact` construction via the director (`ContactController`).
2. Director uses builder (`ContactBuilder`) to construct `Contact` via attribute-setting methods.
3. `ContactBuilder` assembles `Contact` parts.
4. Client retrieves final `Contact` product from the builder.

#### When to Use

- Use Builder pattern for complex object construction with multiple steps and configurations.

#### Example

You can see code demonstrates Builder pattern for creating, editing, and deleting `Contact` objects.
