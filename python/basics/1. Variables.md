# Understanding Variables in Python 
## What is a Variable? 
A variable in Python is essentially a label that is used to store data or values in the computer's memory. You can think of a variable as a container that holds information. This information can be numbers, strings, lists, or even more complex data structures. 
### Key Points about Variables: 
**No Data Type Declaration Needed:** 
Python is dynamically typed, meaning you do not need to declare the type of a variable. The type is inferred based on the value you assign to it at runtime. For example: 
```python 
age = 25 # Python infers that 'age' is an integer 
name = "Alice" # 'name' is a string
```
This makes Python more flexible and beginner-friendly compared to statically typed languages like Java or C++.

**Variable Names are Case Sensitive:** 
In Python, variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that `age` and `Age` are two distinct variables.
```python 
age = 25 
Age = 30 
print(age) # 25 
print(Age) # 30
```

**Naming Variables with Multiple Words** 
#### 1. Camel-case: 
Camel case is when the first word starts with a lowercase letter and every subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter. we often use camelCase for methods or external API call.
```python 
data = response.json() # e.g., {"firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe", "emailAddress": "john.doe@example.com"} 

# Handling camelCase keys in Python 
firstName = data['firstName'] 
lastName = data['lastName'] 
emailAddress = data['emailAddress']
```
In this case, when parsing the JSON data returned from the API, the Python variables are named in **camelCase** (`firstName`, `lastName`, `emailAddress`) to match the API response.

**When to use camelCase in Python**:

-   When dealing with JSON data from external APIs (which often use camelCase).
-   When interacting with JavaScript front-end code that uses camelCase.
-   In scenarios where you're maintaining consistency with the naming conventions of the system you're integrating with (e.g., front-end JavaScript).


#### 2. Camel-case: 
Pascal case capitalizes the first letter of each word, including the first one. This is typically used for class names. sometimes used for mapping the API data too

```python 
import requests
 # Class names in PascalCase (following Python convention for classes) 
 class UserProfile:
       #remaining elements/code 
```
Example of Mapping API data using PascalCase:
```python 
# it doesnt mean to mapping the data we need to use PascalCase its upto the preference
data = response.json() # e.g., {"firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe", "emailAddress": "john.doe@example.com"} 

# Handling camelCase keys in Python 
FirstName = data['firstName'] 
LastName = data['lastName'] 
EmailAddress = data['emailAddress']
```
**When to use PascalCase in Python**:

-   **PascalCase** is primarily used for **class names** in Python (following PEP 8).
-   It may also be used for **mapping API data** when dealing with external systems that use PascalCase (such as JavaScript or some external APIs).
-   When mapping API responses or interacting with external libraries that follow PascalCase, it's common to keep the data in that format for clarity and consistency.


#### 3. Snake-case: 
**snake_case** is the Pythonic naming convention used for variable names, function names, and method names. It involves writing all words in lowercase, separated by underscores (`_`). This is the most common and recommended naming style in Python
```python 
user_email = request.json.get('email') # Variable in snake_case 
user_password = request.json.get('password') # Variable in snake_case
```

### Key notes about Variable naming convention: 
-   **Snake case** is the recommended style for variable and function names according to PEP8.
-   **Pascal case** is used for class names.
-   **Camel case** is often used for external API calls.

### Assigning Multiple Values to Multiple Variables (Tuple Unpacking)
In Python, you can assign multiple values to multiple variables in a single line using **tuple unpacking**.
```python 
db_host, db_user, db_password = "localhost", "admin", "secret" # values will be assined sequeancially
print(db_host, db_user, db_password)
```

### Assigning Same Value to Multiple Variables 
You can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line. This is useful when you need to initialize several variables with the same value.
```python 
connection_status = request_status = server_status = "Pending" 
print(connection_status, request_status, server_status)
```

### Unpacking Collections (Lists, Tuples) 
If you have a collection such as a list or tuple, you can unpack it into separate variables. Collection in python means list or tuple etc. unpack collection means if I have any list or tuple then distribute those lists indexes data into the variables
```python 
roles = ['admin', 'editor', 'subscriber'] 
admin, editor, subscriber = roles 
print(admin, editor, subscriber)
```

### Output variables 
```python 
# separate variables print with string -comma/plus needed to be used to separate
print("Roles in my systems are " , admin,",", editor,",",subscriber , " in future we'll add more")
print("Roles in my systems are " + admin + "," + editor + ","+ subscriber + " in future we'll add more")
```

### Global and Local Variables
Local variables can be accessed only within the function or block where it is defined, whereas global variables are accessed throughout the entire program
```python 
# Global variable 
app_status = "online" 
def enable_maintenance_mode(): # Local variable with the same name as the global variable 
 	     app_status = "offline" 
         print("The app is now in maintenance mode:", app_status) # Calling the function enable_maintenance_mode() 
# Checking the global status of the application 
print("Global app status:", app_status)
```
**Explanation**:

-   The global variable `app_status` is set to `"online"`.
-   Inside the `enable_maintenance_mode()` function, a **local variable** with the same name `app_status` is set to `"offline"`, affecting only the function's scope.
-   The global `app_status` remains unchanged outside the function.
