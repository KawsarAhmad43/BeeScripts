# Python Data Types Overview
In Python, data types represent the type of a variable. Data types are crucial in defining the nature of the data that you are working with, and they affect the operations that can be performed.

## Here are the primary data types:

- Numbers: int, float, complex
- Text: str
- Boolean: bool
- Sequences: list, tuple, range
- Mappings: dict
- Sets: set, frozenset
- Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview
- NoneType: None

### 1. Numbers (int, float, complex)
#### Overview:
- int: Integer numbers, e.g., 42, -100.
- float: Floating point numbers (decimals), e.g., 3.14, -0.01.
- complex: Complex numbers, e.g., 1+2j.
**Real-life Application in Web Development:**
- int: Used for counting items, like user registrations, page views, etc.
- float: Used in calculations involving prices, percentages, or financial data.
- complex: Rarely used, but could be useful in data science or advanced mathematical computations.

#### Type Casting: 
```python
int_var = 42
float_var = float(int_var)  # int to float
complex_var = complex(int_var)  # int to complex
```
